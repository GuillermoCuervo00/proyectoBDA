The Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution, or First Industrial Revolution, is the process of economic, social, and technological transformation that began in the second half of the 18th century in the Kingdom of Great Britain, spreading a few decades later to much of Western Europe and Anglo-Saxon America, and concluding between 1820 and 1840. During this period, humanity experienced the greatest set of economic, technological, and social changes since the Neolithic, transitioning from a rural economy primarily based on agriculture and trade to an urban, industrialized, and mechanized economy.

The Industrial Revolution marks a turning point in history, modifying and influencing all aspects of daily life. Agricultural and emerging industrial production multiplied, while production time decreased. Starting in 1800, wealth and per capita income multiplied as never before, since until then, per capita GDP had remained practically stagnant for centuries.

From this moment, a transition began that ended centuries of labor based on manual work and animal traction, which were replaced by machinery for industrial manufacturing and the transportation of goods and passengers. This transition started in the late 18th century with the textile industry, as well as with the extraction and use of coal. The expansion of trade was made possible by the development of communications, with the construction of railways, canals, and roads. The shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy influenced the population, which experienced rapid urban growth.

The introduction of James Watt's steam engine (patented in 1769) was key to this revolution, as its use dramatically increased production capacity. Later, the development of steam-powered ships and railways, as well as the internal combustion engine and electrical energy in the second half of the 19th century, represented unprecedented technological progress.

As a consequence of industrial development, new social groups were born: the proletariat (industrial workers and poor peasants) and the bourgeoisie (owners of the means of production). This social division generated labor and social problems, popular protests, and new ideologies such as unionism, socialism, anarchism, and communism.

Historians such as Eric Hobsbawm argue that the Industrial Revolution began in the 1780s, although its effects would not be clearly felt until 1830 or 1840. Others, such as Thomas Southcliffe Ashton, place its beginnings between 1760 and 1830.

The term “Industrial Revolution” is also a subject of debate. Some historians argue that the change was gradual and question the word “revolution.” Additionally, they point out that it was not only industrial but also included agrarian, social, and demographic changes.
Background and Causes

The beginnings of industrialization in Europe date back to the Modern Age. Starting in the 16th century, there were advances in trade, navigation, and technical progress, but these were always limited by wars, epidemics, and famines. The Renaissance, with the rise of capitalism in Holland and Italy, marked a significant shift.

One of the main triggers of the Industrial Revolution was necessity. The Napoleonic Wars disrupted imports, which forced local production. Industrialization began in Great Britain due to factors such as the availability of coal, the development of the steam engine, international trade, and a political system more favorable to economic growth.
Great Britain as the Cradle of the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution originated in England thanks to key factors:

    Availability of essential raw materials, such as coal.
    Technical innovations like James Watt’s steam engine and improvements in iron production.
    More inclusive political and social institutions, such as the parliamentary monarchy.
    Development of international trade, with a colonial network that provided raw materials and markets for manufactured products.

The development of the railway and the steamship was essential for the expansion of the Industrial Revolution. The railway, born in the 18th century, revolutionized transportation by increasing speed and load capacity. At the same time, the steamship drastically reduced navigation times, connecting markets and fostering international trade.
